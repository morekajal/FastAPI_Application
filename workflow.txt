Technical stack covered :
    - FastAPI : for building APIs as well as web apps
    - FastAPI needs an Asynchronous web server to execute. eg: Uvicorn, Hypercorn etc.
    - Version Control System : Git
    - Codebase / code hosting : GitHub
    - PyTest : Used for executing unit tests that we have written
    - SQL Alchemy : ORM 
    - Postgress : for database, this is production based database, if you dont want to use this, you can also setup SQLite (file system based database)
    - Jinja2 Templates : To buils web app using HTML screens. 


Directory Setup :
1. Create folder 
2. Separate env : python -m venv venv
3. Version Control System with Git : Inside venv
    - git init 
    - create .gitignore file from the pallette
    - We should include all such files/folders which we dont want to push to git repo.
    - 

** Folder : Backend
* Hello FastAPI
- create requirements.txt containing versions of fastapi and Uvicorn
- cd backend : pip install -r requirements.txt

- main.py : this provides the main entry point for our fastapi application
    from fastapi import FastAPI : import the FastAPI class
    app - object of this class 
    @ : Decorator - to provide path operation
    Define some function Inside this Decorator

    - make sure you are in the working Directory : uvicorn main:app --reload
    - Follow the link
    - Can also check the FastAPI documentation from : http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

** HTTP Verbs & Usage:
- GET request : Used to retrirve some data from particular resource
- POST request : Used to create a new record to the specified resource.
- PUT request : Used to Update the record
    - PATCH request : Used for Partial Update
- DELETE request : Used to Delete particular record from the specified resource

** Refactoring Project Configuration Variables
- To keep track and maintain the project configurations and variables 
- This is important because on different environments like staging env, production env - we need to have different values for these configuration variables
- backend/core/config.py : Create class and its Object and then import in main.py

** Set up git repo :
- Check with : git init
- If not recognized : Download Git and install on your machine
- Go to current directory and initialize empty git with init
- Configure the credentials with :
    - git config user.name "your user name"
    - git config user.email "your email id"

- git status
- git add . - to add all files
    - you can add .gitignore and untrack the files/folders which you dont want to push in git repo.
- git commit -m "Initial Commit"
- git branch -M main
- git remote add origin git@github.com:morekajal/FastAPI_Application.git
- git push -u origin main
