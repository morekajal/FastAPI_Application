Technical stack covered :
    - FastAPI : for building APIs as well as web apps
    - FastAPI needs an Asynchronous web server to execute. eg: Uvicorn, Hypercorn etc.
    - Version Control System : Git
    - Codebase / code hosting : GitHub
    - PyTest : Used for executing unit tests that we have written
    - SQL Alchemy : ORM 
    - Postgress : for database, this is production based database, if you dont want to use this, you can also setup SQLite (file system based database)
    - Jinja2 Templates : To buils web app using HTML screens. 


Directory Setup :
1. Create folder 
2. Separate env : python -m venv venv
3. Version Control System with Git : Inside venv
    - git init 
    - create .gitignore file from the pallette
    - We should include all such files/folders which we dont want to push to git repo.
    - 

** Folder : Backend
* Hello FastAPI
- create requirements.txt containing versions of fastapi and Uvicorn
- cd backend : pip install -r requirements.txt

- main.py : this provides the main entry point for our fastapi application
    from fastapi import FastAPI : import the FastAPI class
    app - object of this class 
    @ : Decorator - to provide path operation
    Define some function Inside this Decorator

    - make sure you are in the working Directory : uvicorn main:app --reload
    - Follow the link
    - Can also check the FastAPI documentation from : http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

** HTTP Verbs & Usage:
- GET request : Used to retrirve some data from particular resource
- POST request : Used to create a new record to the specified resource.
- PUT request : Used to Update the record
    - PATCH request : Used for Partial Update
- DELETE request : Used to Delete particular record from the specified resource

** WSGI : Web Server Gateway Interface 
- Long standing python standards for connecting *Synchronous Python web application to web server
- Concurrency model is Synchronous i.e Each request is handled by a single callable that returns a response before next line of your code runs.
- Parallelism is achieved by multiple worker processes/threads at Server level.
- Protocols supported are HTTP/1.1 request/response 
- Does not support Websocket or Long live streaming
- Deployment Pattern : 
    - Typical stack : Nginx -> Gunicorn/uWSGI -> Django/Flask app


** ASGI : Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface
- Its a new standard that generalizes WSGI to support both *Sync and *Async code and *Multiple Protocols
- Provides flexible interface for modern Python servers like Uvicorn, Hypercorn, Daphne - that can use *asyncio
- Concurrency model : Asynchronous with *async/await, 
- A single process can handle many concurrent connections efficiently 
- Protocols supported : HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, Websocket, and lifespan protocols for startup/shutdown signals.
- Deployment Pattern : 
    - Typical stack : Nginx -> Uvicorn/Hypercorn/Daphne (ASGI workers) ->Django (ASGI), Starlette, FastAPI etc.

** Refactoring Project Configuration Variables
- To keep track and maintain the project configurations and variables 
- This is important because on different environments like staging env, production env - we need to have different values for these configuration variables
- backend/core/config.py : Create class and its Object and then import in main.py

** Set up git repo : ./backend
- Check with : git init
- If not recognized : Download Git and install on your machine
- Go to current directory and initialize empty git with init
- Configure the credentials with :
    - git config user.name "your user name"
    - git config user.email "your email id"

- git status
- git add . - to add all files
    - you can add .gitignore and untrack the files/folders which you dont want to push in git repo.
- git commit -m "Initial Commit"
- git branch -M main
- git remote add origin git@github.com:user_name/FastAPI_Application.git
- git push -u origin main
### Had an error while setting up github on terminal, because of SSH and HTTP access, choose HTTP access and configuration to setup github on local.

** Type HINT : It's super important when working on Production grade projects
- As python is Dynamically typed language, so the Interpreter *Does Not Check Types at the Compile time, rather it does in the runtime. 
- Why should we care about Type Hints:
    - Easier to understand, debug, find bugs to take the code further.
